## Database
In the table, _ingredients list_, the category tag is left empty for now, but likely later there might be scientific findings related to an ingredient (like an "irritant, hydrating, some sort of acid, idk). basically treat this as an aux tag for future uses

Scientific Research 
- Reddit comment summarizing the research: 
> The vast majority of conditioners use both. Cationic agents are easy to spot by their names. Come common ones are polyquats, chlorides, and amodimethicone. There are other ones but you can easily search online to see if an ingredient is cationic. Cationic conditioners are effective at low percentages so don't be worried if you see them far down on an ingredient list. Hydrophobic ingredients like oils and silicones are mainly what use dilution. I think you'd have a hard time finding a modern, store bought conditioner that doesn't use both of these methods.

- [Interactions of cationic formulations on human hair: Effects on cuticle texture and cortex porosity](https://dc.engconfintl.org/cosmetic/17/)

- Summary from this article:
> We used two types of leave on formulation on bleached hair, the first formula containing cationic ingredients and the second formula without cationic. The formulation without cationic showed a significant reduction of cortex porosity, about 70% compared to the bleached hair only. Meanwhile another formulation, did not show the same performance.

> The data obtained indicate that the conditioner formulation can improve hair texture and decrease cortex porosity. The charge-charge interaction allows the adsorption or diffusion of the formulation ingredients into the hair.
